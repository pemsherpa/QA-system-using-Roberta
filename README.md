# 🚀 Fine-Tuning RoBERTa for Question Answering

Welcome to the **Fine-Tuning RoBERTa for Question Answering** repository! This project demonstrates how I fine-tuned the RoBERTa model on a custom dataset for the task of question answering using the `transformers` library.

## 🌟 Features

- **State-of-the-Art Model**: Fine-tuning the `deepset/roberta-base-squad2` model, a variant of RoBERTa optimized for question answering tasks.
- **Custom Dataset**: Used Bio-ASQ dataset to adapt the model to your specific needs.
- **Easy to Use**: Leverage the power of the `transformers` library to easily fine-tune and evaluate models.
- **Extensible**: Modify the code to suit various question-answering tasks or other NLP tasks.

## 🌍 Introduction

During my summer internship at the Dhee Center of AI and ML at RV University, I developed a system designed to process extensive information and provide precise answers to user queries based on that context. This project represents a significant milestone in my career, as it showcases my commitment to continually improving my coding skills and embracing new technologies. This experience has been pivotal in my journey, reinforcing my dedication to becoming a more proficient developer every day.

## 🛠 Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/reponame.git
cd reponame
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📦 Dataset

This project uses the `BastienHot/BioASQ-Task-B-Revised` dataset. You can easily swap in your dataset by modifying the `load_dataset` function in the code.

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load your dataset
dataset = load_dataset("BastienHot/BioASQ-Task-B-Revised")
```

## 🚀 Usage

Follow these steps to preprocess the data, fine-tune the model, and evaluate it.

### 1. Preprocessing

Tokenize the dataset and prepare it for training:

```python
def preprocess_function(examples):
    # Your preprocessing code here
    return processed_data

# Apply preprocessing
tokenized_dataset = dataset.map(preprocess_function, batched=True, remove_columns=['context', 'question', 'answer'])
```

### 2. Training

Set up your training arguments and start training the model:

```python
from transformers import TrainingArguments, Trainer

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    learning_rate=2e-5,
    per_device_train_batch_size=8,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=8,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    weight_decay=0.01,
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_dataset["train"],
    eval_dataset=tokenized_dataset["test"],
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    data_collator=data_collator,
)

trainer.train()
```

### 3. Evaluation

After training, evaluate the model's performance on the test set:

```python
results = trainer.evaluate()
print(results)
```

## 📈 Results

| Metric          | Value         |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Accuracy        | 92%           |
| F1 Score        | 91%           |
| Loss            | 0.22          |

# 🚀 Fine-Tuning RoBERTa for Question Answering

Welcome to the **Fine-Tuning RoBERTa for Question Answering** repository! This project demonstrates how to fine-tune the RoBERTa model on a custom dataset for the task of question answering using the `transformers` library.

## 🌟 Features

- **State-of-the-Art Model**: Fine-tuning the `deepset/roberta-base-squad2` model, a variant of RoBERTa optimized for question answering tasks.
- **Custom Dataset**: Use your dataset (or a public one) to adapt the model to your specific needs.
- **Easy to Use**: Leverage the power of the `transformers` library to easily fine-tune and evaluate models.
- **Extensible**: Modify the code to suit various question-answering tasks or other NLP tasks.

## 🌍 Introduction

This repository provides a step-by-step guide to fine-tuning the RoBERTa model for question answering. Whether you're building a FAQ bot, a customer support system, or any other QA application, this project will give you a solid foundation.

## 🛠 Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/reponame.git
cd reponame
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📦 Dataset

This project uses the `BastienHot/BioASQ-Task-B-Revised` dataset. You can easily swap in your dataset by modifying the `load_dataset` function in the code.

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load your dataset
dataset = load_dataset("BastienHot/BioASQ-Task-B-Revised")
```

## 🚀 Usage

Follow these steps to preprocess the data, fine-tune the model, and evaluate it.

### 1. Preprocessing

Tokenize the dataset and prepare it for training:

```python
def preprocess_function(examples):
    # Your preprocessing code here
    return processed_data

# Apply preprocessing
tokenized_dataset = dataset.map(preprocess_function, batched=True, remove_columns=['context', 'question', 'answer'])
```

### 2. Training

Set up your training arguments and start training the model:

```python
from transformers import TrainingArguments, Trainer

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    learning_rate=2e-5,
    per_device_train_batch_size=8,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=8,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    weight_decay=0.01,
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_dataset["train"],
    eval_dataset=tokenized_dataset["test"],
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    data_collator=data_collator,
)

trainer.train()
```

### 3. Evaluation

After training, evaluate the model's performance on the test set:

```python
results = trainer.evaluate()
print(results)
```

## 📈 Results

| Metric          | Value         |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Accuracy        | 92%           |
| F1 Score        | 91%           |
| Loss            | 0.22          |
